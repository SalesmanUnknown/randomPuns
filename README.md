# Random Programmer Puns


This is a simple project I made using Vue.js to test out my new RESTful API.

It is nothing special.

Only dependency I used was ``` axios ```

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```
